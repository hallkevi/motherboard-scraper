# motherboard-scraper
A screen scraper coded in Python to extract relevant product information from an online marketplace.

We are going to web scrape all relevant product data of motherboards from newegg.com and do a quick analysis of the data. More specifically we want to answer the following questions:  

What are the top 10 best selling products? 
What price range are we looking at? 
What are the main competitors and are there open market chances to benefit from? 

Generating our data set: Webscraping in Python

Writing the scraper

Iâ€™m using Python 3.6 for writing our screen scraper. The BeautifulSoup package makes html parsing executable with the help of CSS selectors for node selection. We are not using other parsing techniques like Xpath.
